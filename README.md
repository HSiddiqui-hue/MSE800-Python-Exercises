# MSE800 – Python Exercises  
This repository contains all Python activities for **Week 1 and Week 2** of the MSE800 (Master of Software Engineering) course.

The tasks include data types, gross pay calculation, recursion, debugging, and requirements management.

## Python Environments Used

### **Environment 1 — HSMSEO**
Used for:
- Week 1 Activities
- Week 2 recursion tasks
- Debugging tasks
- Generating `requirements.txt`

### **Environment 2 — Income Tax Environment **
Used to:
- Show the Income Tax Calculator running in a fresh environment  
- Demonstrate environment isolation

## Week 1 Activities

### **W1 – Activity 1: Multi-Type Profile**
- Demonstrates Python basic data types:
  - String  
  - Integer  
  - List  
  - Tuple  
  - Dictionary  
  - Set  
- Outputs data in a formatted table  
- Inline comments included  

### **W1 – Activity 2: Gross Pay Calculator**
- Takes user inputs  
- Calculates gross pay  
- Applies NZ tax rules  
- Shows final income  
- Includes input validation & comments  

### **W1 – Activity 3: Fibonacci & Factorial (Two Versions)**
1. **Version 1 – Using loops only**  
2. **Version 2 – Using `math` package**  

## Week 2 Activities

### **W2 – Activity 1: Recursive Fibonacci & Factorial**
- Removes loops  
- Pure recursion  
- Includes memory stack explanation (push/pop)

### **W2 – Activity 2: Requirements File**
- Generated using:

### **W2 – Activity 3: Debugging**
- Debugged version of recursive factorial program  
- Fixed input errors  
- Added proper validation  
- Tested with breakpoints in VS Code  

## How to Run the Programs

1. Open terminal  
2. Activate environment:

## GitHub Workflow  
- All work performed in VS Code linked to GitHub  
- Commits are grouped by activity completion  
- Repository will continue to grow as the course progresses
